# Foundations-of-UX
UX designers help make technology easier to understand and more enjoyable to use.

User Experience - how a person , the user feels   about interacting with or experiencing a product.
Product - a good service or feature

A user to have a good experience requires:
1. Usable - making something easy to use
2. Equitable - your designs are useful & marketable to people with diverse abilities & backgrounds
3. Enjoyable - creating a positive connection between the user and a product
4. Useful -

When people like a product, they use that product alot , and they recommend it to their friends

UX designers are empathetic. Empathy is the ability to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation and this is a major part of UX.

There are many types of designers like
1. Interaction designers - who focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions.
2. Visual designers - how a product or technology works.
3. Motion designers - think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product
4. Graphic designers - visuals that tell a story or message


Graphic designers usually work on the appearance of physical products.
UX designers focus on how users interact with the product.

UX researchers conduct studies or interviewd that help us to learn how people use a product.
UX writers think about how to make the language within a product cleare to make user experience more intuitive.
Production designers often act as a bridge between interaction designers and engineers.
And make sure the first and final designd match in the finished product materiald and the assets are ready to be handed off to engineering team.

Assets - everything from trxt and images to design specifications like font style, color , size , and spacing.
UX engineers - translate designs intent into a functioning experience like a website or an app.
Ux program managers - ensure clear and timely communication so that process of building a useful product moves smoothly from start to finish.
